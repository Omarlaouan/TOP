# Flexbox
Flexbox is a way to arrange items in rows or columns 
"Flex" = growing or shrinking

### Flex container and flex items
- Flex container = contains flex items, have property display: flex
- Flex items = Are inside a container
- A flex item can be a flex container by adding property display: flex, and can contain flex items itself
- With flexbox, you can create and nest flex containers and items as you want

QUestions : 
- didnt understand the two examples (why flex items are created differently? )
