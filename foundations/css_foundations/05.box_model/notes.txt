# Video : learn CSS box model in 8min
- Every element in a CSS is a box. 

- You can make boxes appear on each element by adding in the css : 
* {
  outline: 2px solid red;
}

- Margin is shared between two elements that are next to each other. 
- The largest margin between the two boxes is considered

- By default, the height and width are not the real height and width (it doest account for padding, border, margin), 
=> Put box-sizing = border-box to make them count (it will adjust with content box)
=> This way, even if you change padding, margin, etc, the height and width will be the one you specified (total size of the element)
=> You should always include this parameter.

# Video : box-sizing: border-box

'box-sizing' argument can take 2 values : 
- content-box (default) : height and width are the size of the content box 
- border-box : height and width is the total size of the box (including padding, border). 
  The browser will adjust the size of the content box to make the total size(content-box + padding + border) = height/width
  Note that the margin is not included because it is not really in the box.
  It is called border-box because it is the size of everything inside the border box (content-box + padding + border)

# Block and inline boxes:
## Outter display type
- Argument 'outer-display' can have 2 values :
  - block : new-line, take a block of space, dont want anything nearby.
  example : <h1>, <p>, <ul> use 'block' as their default outer dislay type
  - inline : inline, live among other elements, tolerate promixity
  example : <a>, <span>, <em>, <strong> use 'inline' as their default outer dislay type

## Inner display type
How elements are displayed inside the box
- Argument 'display' : 
  - flex : the element will use outer display = block and inner display = flex
   Any direct children of the box will be flex items. (reead dflexbox specification)
   (the children elements inside can be moved inside the box)
  - The are other inner display type : grid, etc. 
  - What is display = 'inline-flex'?

## box-sizing 
A good practice : To use the alternative box model for all of your elements 
(which is a common choice among developers), set the box-sizing property on the 
<html> element and set all other elements to inherit that value. 

html {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

*,
*::before,
*::after {
  box-sizing: inherit;
}

## Playing with box models
Adjusting width and height of "box alternate" to match "box"
.box {
  border: 5px solid rebeccapurple;
  background-color: lightgray;
  padding: 40px;
  margin: 40px;
  width: 300px;
  height: 150px;
}

.alternate {
  box-sizing: border-box;
  height: 230px; height(150) +  padding x 2 (40 x 2) + margin??
  width: 400px; width (300px) + padding x 2 (40 x 2) + margin??

}

## Margin
The margin is always added after the size of the visible box has been calculated.
4 arguments : margin-top, margin-bottom, margin-right, margin-left
Negative margin = the box collapse with it neighboor

### Margin collapsing
Margins collapse following these rules:
Two positive margins will collapse into the largest (30 + 10 = 30)
Two negative margins will collapse into the smallest (-15 + -5 = -15)
For two margins with differents signs, they will be sumed (-25 + 20 = -5 or -25 + 35 = 10)


## Borders 
As margin, it has 4 shape args : top, buttom, right, left
And 3 style args : width, style, color. 
You can combine the two if desired : border-top-color : red, border-right-width : 12px, etc.  

## Padding 
4 shape args : top, buttom, right, left
