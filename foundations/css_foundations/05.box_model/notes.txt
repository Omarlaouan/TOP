Video : learn CSS box model in 8min
- Every element in a CSS is a box. 

- You can make boxes appear on each element by adding in the css : 
* {
  outline: 2px solid red;
}

- Margin is shared between two elements that are next to each other. 
The largest magin between two neighboors box will be the one selected. 

- By default, the height and width are not the real height and width (it doest account for padding, border, margin), 
=> Put box-sizing = border-box to make them count (it will adjust with content box)
=> This way, even if you change padding, margin, etc, the height and width will be the one you specified (total size of the element)
=> You should always include this parameter.
