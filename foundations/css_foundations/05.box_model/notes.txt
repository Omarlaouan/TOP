Video : learn CSS box model in 8min
- Every element in a CSS is a box. 

- You can make boxes appear on each element by adding in the css : 
* {
  outline: 2px solid red;
}

- Margin is shared between two elements that are next to each other. 
- The largest margin between the two boxes is considered

- By default, the height and width are not the real height and width (it doest account for padding, border, margin), 
=> Put box-sizing = border-box to make them count (it will adjust with content box)
=> This way, even if you change padding, margin, etc, the height and width will be the one you specified (total size of the element)
=> You should always include this parameter.

Video : box-sizing: border-box

'box-sizing' argument can take 2 values : 
- content-box (default) : height and width are the size of the content box 
- border-box : height and width is the total size of the box (including padding, border). 
  The browser will adjust the size of the content box to make the total size(content-box + padding + border) = height/width
  Note that the margin is not included because it is not really in the box.
  It is called border-box because it is the size of everything inside the border box (content-box + padding + border)
