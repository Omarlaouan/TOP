# Block and Inline 

### Block vs inline
Controled by argument display : block / inline / inline-block
- block = start at a new line and take the whole line. ie <h1>, <p>, etc.
- inline = is inside the line with other content (if they are inline). ie <em>, <strong>, <a>
- inline-block = behave like inline elements but with block padding and margin (Not used in practice, you will use flexbox)

### Divs and spans
Contrary to <em>, <strong>, <p>, div and spans are generic boxes that give no particular meaning to their content.
Use cases : 
- Style some specific elements
- Style a group of related elements

#### Div
Div is a block element but default. 
It is used as a container element to group other elements. 
We can them apply some styling to these groups. 
#### Span
Span is an inline element by default. 
Used to group text contentnor other inline html elements for styling. 
It should only be used when no other html element is appropriate.

### Inline vs inline-block vs block : https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/css-display-inline-vs-inline-block
- Inline-block allows to set a width and height on the element
- with display: inline, top and bottom margins & paddings are not respected
- with display: block, a line break happens after the element, so a block element 
    doesnâ€™t sit next to other elements
